The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) repositories constitute a major public resource for sharing diverse types of biomedical data, such as DNA sequences, genes and biological samples. These repositories provide the necessary infrastructure for researchers to submit experimental data and associated metadata as part of the science-dissemination process. However, the corresponding metadata lack use of globally accepted standard identifiers, formats, and terminologies. The ability to find, access, interoperate, and reuse biomedical data sets such as those deposited in the NCBI repositories depends on how well described the associated metadata are. To this end, the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR) develops technologies involving the use of data standards and ontologies to improve biomedical metadata. In this paper, we describe a CEDAR–NCBI data submission prototype that incorporates CEDAR&rsquo;s standards-oriented, ontology-aware technologies to create metadata templates and to enter metadata using these templates for data submission to several NCBI repositories: BioProject, BioSample, and Sequence Read Archive (SRA). We demonstrate how this prototype works by creating NCBI-compatible templates (with extended features) and populating these templates with metadata associated with an Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) sequencing data set from a study of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) patients. Our approach has the potential to improve overall quality of metadata in NCBI as well as non-NCBI repositories.</strong></p>
