Systems biology is playing an increasingly important role in unraveling the complexity of human immune responses. An important aspect of this approach involves the integration and analysis of different types of high-throughput measurements (&ldquo;omics&rdquo; data) to understand or predict the behavior of biological systems under different experimental conditions. With the increase of biological databases, we have seen a proliferation of custom templates provided by different repositories/databases for data submission. Public repositories such as GEO and ArrayExpress provide MIAME-compliant templates for submission of microarray gene expression data. Although these templates represent the same type of data and are compliant with the MIAME standard, they are described using different terminologies (e.g., platform vs. array design). This makes data submission, comparison and integration difficult between different repositories.Methods: We propose a domain-specific architecture to enable mapping of local terms from individual data submission templates to ontology concepts through NCBO ontology annotator. In this paper, We mapped template types such as study, human subject, biosamples, and reagents, template columns (e.g., biosample type and age), and value sets (e.g., controlled values such as serum and urine for biosample type) to ontology concepts found in BioPortal. Results and conclusion: Such ontology term mapping allows us to achieve semantic normalization across different templates used for submitting data to bio-repositories. Ontology-based data standards constitute a powerful way to enable semantic data integration across studies and lower the barriers to data sharing. Experimental results can be shared without the problem of lengthy and ambiguous descriptions of experimental conditions and file formats.</p>
