With the advancement of high-throughput technologies, data in life sciences and healthcare is growing exponentially and in the near future curating it will be beyond the capability of the traditional methods of data management and engineering.Therefore, there is now, more than ever, a need to research and develop new techniques, and infrastructures to leverage vast amounts of data effectively. My current research efforts are concentrated on addressing several core problems in the area of Biomedical Data Science. I research, develop tools and techniques to standardize (to make it machine-readable), federate and derive meaningful information from the heterogeneous **Big Biomedical Data**. I particularly focus on making **Big Data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable)** by incorporating the semantic web, machine learning and related data science technologies. On the application side, my research aims at providing non-technical users with scalable self-service access to data, typically distributed and heterogeneous. Semantic technologies, based on semantic data standards and automated reasoning, alleviate many data access-related challenges faced by biologists and clinicians, such as data fragmentation, necessity to combine data with computation and declarative knowledge in querying, and the difficulty of accessing data for non-technical users. I joined Yale in 2016 since then I have been working with AIRR community and HIPC centers to standardize the adaptive immune receptor repotoire [MiAIRR Nature Paper](http://rdcu.be/E7sS), and [immunology data](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Syed_Ahmad_Chan_Bukhari/publication/303471125_Towards_Ontological_Mapping_of_Immunological_Data_Standards/links/5744659208ae9f741b3e2815.pdf). Scientific experiment reproducablity is a [big challenge](https://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/1.19970!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/533452a.pdf) and poor metadata docuemnted with the  experimental data is one of main reasons. To facilitate the high quality metadata editing and submission processes, I am working with [CEDAR](https://metadatacenter.org/). CEDAR is an NIH BD2K Center of Excellence whose goal is to create a unified framework that researchers in all scientific disciplines can use to create consistent, easily searchable metadata. My developed pipelines to submit controlgy-ontology metadata to the NCBI are [CEDAR-NCBI](https://cedar.metadatacenter.net/templates/edit/https://repo.metadatacenter.net/templates/d71056c8-b4cd-491f-8f84-f3759a15f827?folderId=https:%2F%2Frepo.metadatacenter.net%2Ffolders%2Fe9eeb4a3-449b-4f4b-9db6-fd353d56501f) and [CAIRR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db5WqHUgpOI). My other research in progress efforts include [CEDAR OnDemand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHcRqMps-lw)  [LinkedImm](http://linkedimm.org/) and  [AIRRPort](http://airrport.org/). **My Projects** page provides more detail about my completed and on-going projects.
